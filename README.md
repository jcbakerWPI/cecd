## Technical Achievements
- **Bootstrap table/list**: Used multiple different bootstrap classes of list and table to create an interactive table
                            and an optimal list to hold images (pictures of albums).  Also put list inside the table.
- **Animate.css library**: Imported animate.css library to utilize animation effects on table titles.

### Design Achievements
- **Div Header**: In styles.css, used background-image property to create a very visually appealing, smooth purple header
                  which acted as the basis for my color scheme.
- **Animated table titles**: Used animate.css library to make table titles more eye-catching.
