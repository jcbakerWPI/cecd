As a child, I used to enjoy learning new things and discovering the world around me. I would either lock myself in a room to read my big and colorful books about superheroes, vehicles and animals or go to a park with my mom to play. However, I didn’t feel the need to make new friends because I had all the fun I needed when I was by myself. As I grew up, my parents were proud of having a smart child but they believed that I would eventually develop social issues if I didn’t learn how to make friends. They would also describe me as one of the happiest and careless kids they have ever seen which is probably why I didn’t feel like socializing was a necessity.
          
Around when I was in kindergarten, my parents signed me up for verbal therapy sessions with a very well known therapist close to where I lived. They hoped she would help me come out of my shell when interacting with the other kids in my school. During these sessions I would have long conversations with my therapist about any of the topics she would bring up, which I enjoyed very much, but from my perspective, I didn’t understand why my parents were dropping me off her office to talk with her every day. This was also during the same time period when I started to play with Legos very often and fortunately for me I was allowed to bring Legos to my therapy sessions because it was a great topic that would make me start to talk. I didn’t realize I was actually learning how to make connections with people, even if I was just talking about Legos or other things I like.
          
On the last day of kindergarten, the teacher allowed everyone to bring in their favorite toy. I was observing carefully what my classmates brought, and I was excited when I discovered that some of the other kids also brought in Legos to school. I approach one of the kids who brought Legos and asked him if he wanted to play with me. The boy cheerfully responded with a yes and we sat down together to play. As the day went by, more kids who also brought Legos joined me and my new friend to play. It was a very fun day and I was sad that it had to come to an end, but it was the day I first experienced having friends. This experience made me start to understand the importance of friends because they were more fun than sitting by myself at home with only a book.
